Buy a Kindle,Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime),4.0,1138,"[""In the wee hours of a 1960s Tokyo morning, a dead body is found under the rails of a train, and the victim's face is so badly damaged that police have a hard time figuring out the victim’s identity. Only two clues surface: an old man, overheard talking in a distinctive accent to a young man, and the word “kameda.” Inspector Imanishi leaves his beloved bonsai and his haiku and goes off to investigate—and runs up against a blank wall. Months pass in fruitless questioning, in following up leads, until the case is closed, unsolved.But Imanishi is dissatisfied, and a series of coincidences lead him back to the case. Why did a young woman scatter pieces of white paper out of the window of a train? Why did a bar girl leave for home right after Imanishi spoke to her? Why did an actor, on the verge of telling Imanishi something important, drop dead of a heart attack? What can a group of nouveau young artists possibly have to do with the murder of a quiet and “saintly” provincial old ex-policemen?

Books,Sounds from the Heart: Learning to Listen to Girls,5.0,2,"['Sounds from the Heart'
 ""is about girls-their learning, their social dilemmas, their dreams, hopes, and fears-and one teacher's struggle to help them reach their full potential.""
 ""Maureen Barbieri's book takes a careful, deliberate, and often disturbing look at the experiences of a group of adolescent girls as they are nudged into meaningful literacy. Drawing on the work of Nel Noddings, Carol Gilligan, Myra and David Sadker, as well as the theories of Donald Murray and Donald Graves, she asks tough questions about the role of literacy in girls' lives. Do we know what our girls are thinking? Do we make room for their questions in our classrooms? How can we support risk taking at a time when the need to feel safe, secure, and accepted seems uppermost in their minds?""
 'We hear about the obstacles Maureen faces, times when she stumbles along the way and contributes to the ""voice training"" that women so often inflict on girls. Because she recognizes in herself a desire to avoid conflict at all costs, Maureen must work hard to take on the specific needs of girls. Her students collaborate with her to become curriculum builders as they explore such loaded issues as duplicity, vengeance, and homophobia in their literature and especially in their writing and talking.'
 ""Maureen invites readers to ask new questions about curriculum, evaluation, co-education, choice, risk, and conflict. In a final chapter, she examines the more common classroom situation- boys and girls together-and suggests innovative ways to ensure that girls' voices continue to be heard.""

 'The English Monster' '21' 'JUNE' '1585'
 'The ancient road began at the Tower and ran east to west along a terrace of gravel. To the east it disappeared into the flat treeless horizon of the estuary, merging into the earth just as the earth merged into the sea at the muddy edge of England. As it left London, this road, which in only a few years would become a highway, formed the northern boundary of a dreary region of swampy land. The great river, as it bent south then north again, formed the southern edge of this semicircle of marshland. It had been drained and flooded, drained and flooded half a dozen times in the previous fifty years, while England burned Protestants then Catholics and then Protestants again. This place could not seem to decide if it was of the river or of the earth. The ancient name for the misbegotten half-land was Wapping. No one could remember where the name came from. In recent years small wharves and little clusters of houses had appeared along the riverbank at Wapping. The rich men who funded the buildings decided that houses and wharves would do a better job of keeping out the river than the sea walls they’d been building for decades in their vain attempts to reclaim the land from the waters. And, more to the point, a wharf generated more profit than a wall. During the days men made themselves busy around the dozens of boats that moored up along the wharves, the vessels settling down into the riverbed when the tide went out and rising again as it flooded back in, washing up against the wood-and-brick pilings. The pickings were not rich. London’s most lucrative trade still headed further upstream toward the wharves that operated within the city walls, but a new gray economy was emerging here downstream at Wapping. Beyond this sliver of moneymaking and building, back behind the wharves, between the river and the road, were the marshes. The occasional flood still occurred, sweeping away families and livelihoods as well as the property of the men of business. This dank, oozing landscape, unpromising and undeveloped, was the result of the river’s inundations. The ground was low, lower than sea level in some places, rising up to the bluff along which the road ran to the north. A man could stand there in the marshes, his feet sinking into the mud, and look to the backs of the wharves and warehouses along the river and imagine that they were floating on water. There was a gap in the riverside development, and in this gap stood a group of gallows. The gallows lived on borrowed time—already there were complaints that this place of execution was dragging down the land value of investments. Could it not be moved downstream a bit, perhaps to Ratcliffe, somewhere benighted and undeveloped where men of business were not trying to attract custom? But for now the gallows still stood. On this midsummer’s eve there were six river pirates hanging there. The gallows were right at the water’s edge, set in among the wharves. The six unfortunates hanging from the ropes had been caught after leaping aboard a barge in the river. It had been their sixth attack in four weeks and it was to be their last. The local lightermen and watermen had banded together to bait a trap for them, putting out stories that a barge with wool intended for France and Spain would be traveling downstream that day. When the pirates had clambered onboard, a group of twenty river men hidden beneath sails had emerged and captured them, but sadly not before the pirates, or at least, reported most of the ambushers, the apparent captain of the pirates, whose knife had flashed more quickly and more viciously than those of his crew, had sent three of the Wapping lightermen into the embrace of the old river, their throats slashed and their eyes empty. Eventually the men overcame the pirates and after some cursory discussions with what passed for the authorities in this new outpost they decided upon a customary punishment. The pirates were hanged at Execution Dock, where they would be left for three tides as a signal to others (and perhaps an offering to the river) before being cut down and disposed of. The river was already rising for the first of these three tides when the leader of the pirates heard a clatter of hoofs on the mixture of mud and stones that constituted the main street here in Wapping, running along the curve of the river behind the wharves. A mighty carriage, it sounded like. The clatter stopped, and he heard the sound of a carriage door slamming. A few minutes later, some squelching footsteps as a man approached. The pirate kept his eyes prudently closed as the footsteps stopped, perhaps directly in front of him. Within two hours, the river would be up to the chins of the men on the gallows, before falling back again. Carefully, the pirate opened one eye halfway. He saw the swaying feet of his dead shipmates on either side of him, and opened the eye a little further. His visitor was standing on the foreshore, dressed in the Dutch style, all somber black and white, the clothes effortlessly wealthier than the new gay and gaudy fashions that were rippling out from the English Queen’s court. The visitor cleared his throat and spat. The pirate heard a small splash in the water, and his careful eyes caught the sun as it glittered on a thick lump of green phlegm which appeared and spun around in the water as it commenced its journey down to Tilbury. The visitor glanced up and behind at the gallows, and the pirate closed his eyes quickly. He resolved to keep his eyes that way as the visitor started to speak, in rich aristocratic tones with just the hint of a clammy Dutch accent. “Quite a view they’ve given you. Desirable waterfront property, I’d say.” The pirate said nothing, obviously. The creaking of the gallows was the only sound as he and his men swung gently in the soft summer breeze. Miles and miles upstream, it was a beautiful evening among the willow trees and reeds at Runny\xadmede and Richmond, where the aristocrats played at court and love and wrote poetry to each other. The sun was setting in the opulent west. But here, to the east of the metropolis, the dominant colors were grays and browns. Mud and water, not trees and flowers. The thought seemed to make the visitor positively cheerful. He put his hands behind his back and actually rose up on his toes at the vista before him. “Someday all this will be very desirable property, captain. When my father built his wall here, he had a vision of a new suburb, with the river kept out and the land turned into meadows and orchards. He wanted this to be the prettiest part of London. And all within sight of that dreadful Tower.” It occurred to the pirate to wonder why the Dutchman was speaking when, as far as the man knew, there was no one there alive to listen to him. The visitor spoke again, and even with his eyes closed the pirate captain had the impression that the Dutchman had turned his back on the river and was facing him. Almost as if he were speaking to him. Perhaps he was practicing an address. “You’ll be the last, captain. The last crew to be hanged on this so-called Execution Dock. It’s keeping the developers away, this grisly habit, and this land is valuable. A hundred years, maybe two hundred, this’ll be the busiest port in the world. Trade is coming, captain. Trade. Not petty thievery or the ridiculous swapping of bits of unmade cloth for bits of food ’n’ drink. The world’s wealth is out there waiting to be bought and sold, and unlike most of my countrymen I predict that the buying and selling will happen here, in London, not in Antwerp or Rotterdam. Wapping’s going to flourish. It’s going to become the hub on which the world turns. You’ll go down in history, captain. The last pirate to be hanged at Wapping. My congratulations.” Another movement, and then the sound of the visitor walking back to his carriage. The slamming door, the “hai!” of the coachman, and the snap of hoofs and wheels on the road back into London. And then only the sound of the creaking gallows again. The tide rose, and later it fell. It rose and it fell three times. When the locals came to cut them down, they were disconcerted to find only five pirates hanging from the gallows. The sixth—the captain—had gone. BOOK'

Books,More Together: 25 Years of Peer Practice at On Our Own Charlottesville,5.0,1,"[""Twenty-five years ago a group of people who had experienced serious mental illness came together to provide support to one another as they sought to heal themselves. That group organized and became On Our Own of Charlottesville, Virginia, a peer run organization. Through the years this community has endeavored to carry out its mission to “provide mutual support, self-help, advocacy and education, information, and referral services to individuals who have experienced significant problems in their lives due to a mental illness—and who acknowledge this; and to advocate for positive changes within the traditional mental health system.” At different stages On Our Own has emphasized different aspects of this mission. The main thing OOO had done over its lifetime is to provide a community of mutual support among peers who join together to support one another on the path to recovery. Out of these relationships, which include a lot of careful and respectful listening, individual and group needs are identified, and plans are made and carried out to meet the various needs that members bring on their road to recovery and robust wellbeing. While this process has sometimes been highly structured and intentional, and at other times informal and less conscious, it has been the same core process that was reaffirmed over and over in different forms with different language and labels over the years: caring. This book shares the things On Our Own learned along the way. Its purpose is to help others form their own organizations, helping people with mental health challenges build caring places of community and mutual growth. In this book you will find tools to develop such an organization, along with a dose of On Our Own's history so that you might learn from its mistakes and successes as you create your own unique healing community.""]","['About the Author'

 'The riveting story of the Germania and its incarnations and exploitations through the ages.The pope wanted it, Montesquieu used it, and the Nazis pilfered an Italian noble\'s villa to get it: the Germania, by the Roman historian Tacitus, took on a life of its own as both an object and an ideology. When Tacitus wrote a not-very-flattering little book about the ancient Germans in 98 CE, at the height of the Roman Empire, he could not have foreseen that the Nazis would extol it as ""a bible,"" nor that Heinrich Himmler, the engineer of the Holocaust, would vow to resurrect Germany on its grounds. But the Germania inspired--and polarized--readers long before the rise of the Third Reich. In this elegant and captivating history, Christopher B. Krebs, a professor of classics at Harvard University, traces the wide-ranging influence of the Germania over a five-hundred-year span, showing us how an ancient text rose to take its place among the most dangerous books in the world. 14 black-and-white illustrations']","['From Publishers Weekly'
 ""Harvard classics professor Krebs writes a scholarly but lucid account of the abuse of history. Written in 98 C.E. by the Roman official Tacitus, About the Origin and Mores of the Germanic Peoples was lost for centuries but resurfaced around 1500 as Germans were growing resentful of foreign domination—in this case from the Catholic Church in Rome. The rediscovered book launched a primitivist myth that captivated admirers over the next 500 years, from Martin Luther to Heinrich Himmler, who loved its portrayal of ancient Germans as freedom-loving warriors, uncultured but honorable, in contrast to decadent Romans. In fact, Tacitus probably never visited Germany, Krebs notes. Rather, using books and travelers' reports, he wrote for a Roman audience who shared his romantic view of northern barbarians. Enthusiastic German readers, culminating in the Nazis, ignored Tacitus's disparaging comments, misread passages to confirm their prejudices, and proclaimed that the ancient historian confirmed their national superiority. This is an inventive analysis of, and warning against, an irresistible human yearning to find written proof of one's ideology. Illus. (May) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.""

Books,Law and Legitimacy in the Supreme Court,4.7,8,"['Winner of the Thomas M. Cooley Book Prize, Georgetown Center on the Constitution'
 'Why do self-proclaimed constitutional “originalists” so regularly reach decisions with a politically conservative valence? Do “living constitutionalists” claim a license to reach whatever results they prefer, without regard to the Constitution’s language and history? In confronting these questions, Richard H. Fallon reframes and ultimately transcends familiar debates about constitutional law, constitutional theory, and judicial legitimacy.Drawing from ideas in legal scholarship, philosophy, and political science, Fallon presents a theory of judicial legitimacy based on an ideal of good faith in constitutional argumentation. Good faith demands that the Justices base their decisions only on legal arguments that they genuinely believe to be valid and are prepared to apply to similar future cases. Originalists are correct about this much. But good faith does not forbid the Justices to refine and adjust their interpretive theories in response to the novel challenges that new cases present. Fallon argues that theories of constitutional interpretation should be works in progress, not rigid formulas laid down in advance of the unforeseeable challenges that life and experience generate.'
 'Law and Legitimacy in the Supreme Court'
 'offers theories of constitutional law and judicial legitimacy that accept many tenets of legal realism but reject its corrosive cynicism. Fallon’s account both illuminates current practice and prescribes urgently needed responses to a legitimacy crisis in which the Supreme Court is increasingly enmeshed.']","['Review'
 ""“Very careful, meticulously researched and referenced, balanced in its treatment of issues, fair to opposing positions, and successful in offering a subtle and nuanced perspective that takes multiple considerations into account, Fallon's treatment of the varieties of legitimacy, of the role of precedent, and of questions of official obedience to Supreme Court rulings will make useful contributions to the now existing literature.”""
 '―' 'Frederick Schauer, University of Virginia School of Law'
 ""“This book stands head and shoulders above the competition in the graceful and insightful way in which it combines Fallon's well-known mastery of constitutional law and practice and his ability to grasp and deploy a deep understanding of the work that philosophy can contribute to constitutional understanding.”""
 '―' 'Jeremy Waldron, author of'
 ""One Another's Equals: The Basis of Human Equality""
 '“Thoughtful and timely…Fallon wisely argues for a conception of legitimate judicial decision-making in which we accept that law is influenced by political, practical, and moral considerations, even as we strive to ensure it is not dominated by them.”'

The Cascade Mountains host conifer-dominated alpine forests where stand-outs like Williamson's Sapsucker, White-headed Woodpecker, and Gray-crowned Rosy-finch live. In the mountains' dry rain shadow to the east, a semi-desert region is home to Greater Sage-grouse and state bird Western Meadowlark. Waterfowl and Sandhill Cranes can be observed by the thousands along wetlands and lakes. Such a variety of birds can be as overwhelming as it is exciting, so it helps to have a portable reference on hand to cut through the clutter and focus on a smaller group of representative species. You can do this with the beautifully illustrated Oregon Birds, which features 140 common and familiar birds as well as an ecoregion map showing over 20 bird-finding hotspots and learning sites.

 'Centuries ago, the murder of a beloved king tore apart the Kingdom of Caledun. The land was plunged into chaos and thousands perished in the aftermath. A new order was established in an attempt to return Caledun to its former glory. It failed, but in its place rose the beginnings of the Code.'
 'During this same period, the mystical caretakers of the Great Wood retreated from the world of Kal Maran, their disappearance an ominous harbinger of the suffering that was to follow. The Great Wood now grows out of control. Cities, towns, and villages have fallen before the relentless march of the forest. Without the former guardians to keep her tame, the wood has become a place of peril, and dark creatures of legend now hunt beneath its leaves.'
 'The summer season is now a time of armed conflict. The fall of the old monarchy has brought about a ceaseless cycle of combat. Grievances are settled by the strict tenets of a binding Mercenary Code and the men who would die to preserve its honour.'
 ""However, change is in the air. Political rivalries have escalated, and dire rumblings of a revolution abound. Thrust to the forefront of the shattered land's politics, a mercenary fights for more than just riches. In the north, a borderland soldier wrestles with his own demons and looks to find his true purpose.

 'About the Author'
 'Born February 12 in Columbus, Ohio, Jacqueline Woodson grew up in Greenville, South Carolina and Brooklyn, New York and graduated from college with a B.A. in English. A former drama therapist for runaways and homeless children in New York City, she now writes full-time and has received The Kenyon Review Award for Literary Excellence in Fiction. Though she spends most of her time writing, Woodson also enjoys reading the works of emerging writers, encouraging young people to write, heated political conversation with her friends, and sewing. At one time, she made most of her own clothing, but now she makes mostly scarves and quilts for her friends.Jacqueline Woodson began to consider becoming a writer when she was chosen to be the literary editor of a magazine in the fifth grade. Eventually, three books helped convince her to pursue a writing career:'
 'The Bluest Eye' 'by Toni Morrison,' 'Daddy Was a Numbers-Runner'
 'by Louise Meriwether, and' 'Ruby'
 'by Rosa Guy. Before reading those books, Woodson thought that only books featuring mainstream, white characters or works by William Shakespeare constituted valid literature. But in those three books, Woodson saw parts of herself and her life, and realized that books could be about people like her; and she knew she wanted to write them.Now a critically acclaimed author, Woodson writes about characters from a variety of races, ethnic groups, and social classes. Woodson says, ""There are all kinds of people in the world, and I want to help introduce readers to the kinds of people they might not otherwise meet."" Woodson\'s books also feature strong female characters. Some are based on her friends, who she says are ""really amazing people who constantly challenge themselves to make a difference in the world."" Woodson often writes about friendship between girls, as she did in her trilogy about Maizon, and'
 ""I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This""
 '. ""Girls rarely get discussed in books and films,"" she says, ""and I want to do \'girl stories\' that show strong, independent people. I think girls are often disregarded in this society and taught to be dependent. I want to show young people that there are other ways to be.""'
 'The House You Pass on the Way'
 'is a moving story of growing up different. It explores questions about emerging sexuality with sensitivity and respect and examines racial tension and the legacy of violence. In a starred review,'
 'Publishers Weekly'
 'noted, ""[Woodson] gently probes questions regarding racism and homosexuality in this poignant tale about growing pains and the ongoing process of self-discovery."" Also in a starred review,'
 'The Horn Book' 'wrote of' 'The House You Pass on the Way'
 ', ""[A] reflective book.... The reader feels grateful that Woodson has whispered her lyrical story to us....""'
 'School Library Journal'
 'remarked that Woodson\'s novel is, ""Richly layered.... Notable both for its quality and for the out-of-the-way places it goes."" Woodson\'s latest book,'
 'Lena'
 '(April 1998, Delacorte Press), is the companion to the Coretta Scott King Honor Book,'
 ""I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This."" 'In a starred review,'

They also need to ensure that the data is backed up regularly, stored effectively, and that the data is highly secure. One will very likely run SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server 2012. There is the new SQL Server 2012 exam coded 70-462 that covers these topics: Install and Configure, Maintain Instances and Databases, Optimize and Troubleshoot, Manage Data, Implement Security, Implement High Availability. Exam 70-432, on the other hand, is all about configuring SQL Server 2008 R2. The topics covered include: Installing and Configuring SQL Server 2008 Maintaining SQL Server Instances Managing SQL Server Security Maintaining a SQL Server Database Performing Data Management Tasks Monitoring and Troubleshooting SQL Server Optimizing SQL Server Performance Implementing High Availability Your job may require that you master both SQL Server versions. SQL Server 2008R2 and SQL Server 2012 share many common features and mechanisms. The two exams have BOKs that look quite different. However, the actual knowledge items involved do overlap a lot so it actually makes sense to study both together. Throughout this book we use screen captures made out of SQL Server 2012. However, unless the text explicitly states a specific version, the contents can be applied towards both versions. We give you knowledge information relevant to the exam specifications. To be able to succeed in the real exams, you’ll need to apply your earned knowledge to the question scenarios. Many of the exam questions are written to be less straight forward. They tend to be framed within the context of short scenarios. The exams are not too difficult. However, coverage is very comprehensive – a wide range of topics are presented in the official topic lists. The exams do not ask you to answer hundreds of questions. In other words, only a small fraction of the official topics will be presented. This ExamFOCUS book focuses on the more difficult topics that will likely make a difference in exam results. The book is NOT intended to guide you through every single official topic.

Books,Redhook: A Microbrew Success Story,4.1,7,"[""Presents a behind-the-scences look at Seattle's Redhook Ale Brewery from its start in 1982 to national prominence""]","['From Kirkus Reviews'
 ""A diverting history of the makers of Redhookmerry pranksters of the brewing businessmildly tainted by Seattleite Krebs's idolatrous tone. From a tumbledown converted transmission shop in Ballard, Wash., came Redhook Ale, an offbeat craft beer that was to the brewing business what Starbucks was to coffee: a blast of fresh air, loaded with character and flavor. And little wonder, as both were the brainchild of Gordon Bowkerin Redhook's case, along with Paul Shipman and the whole brew house cast. Red hook cultivated an eccentric image as the maker of an eccentric product, an ale that reviewers at first described as tasting ``like bananas.'' The wild northwest yeast gave it distinction, claimed Redhooks makers; it was the Belgian style they were really after, they claimed. Actually, the yeast was contaminated, but by then they had a following, so why announce their continuous tinkering? Still, tinker they did, finally getting the yeast right with a chemists help, and also going public, the first microb rewer to do so, with a stock offering that shot skyward. The microbrew market has since bottomed out, and Redhook's bohemian image has been tarnished by expansion that robbed it of its handcrafted cachet. Krebs complements the Redhook story with lots of e ntertaining craft brew tidbits (what puts the steam in Anchor, when is a bottom-fermenting beer an ale), but he also creates a godlike aura around both Bowker and Shipman, as if no one else ever had a good idea when it came to fashioning authentic local p roducts that educated the American palate. The early years make the story herea time when food and drink were in as much ferment as Redhook's bitterand Krebs does tell the story with flair. (20 b&w photos, not seen) --""

 'Soar with Sakaiya on a dizzying journey with this prophetic view of the future. His latest work (he has written 30 books) has already sold over 500,000 copies in Japan and should be successful in this English edition. Sakaiya easily transcends other works in this genre, such as Alvin Toffler\'s The Third Wave ( LJ 4/1/80) or Daniel Bell\'s The Coming of Post-Industrial Society ( LJ 7/73), as he describes a future knowledge-value society. Knowledge-value is ""the price of and the value created by wisdom, and the worth, or price a society gives to that wisdom."" Massive changes will characterize this brave new world, and Sakaiya describes the three main ""disrupters"" as technological advances, population shifts, and dwindling resources. His review of history and broad-brushed approach without footnotes may frustrate some. This is sure to be in demand by CEOs and futurist thinkers and is strongly recommended for most libraries.'
 '- Dale Farris, Groves, Tex.'
 'Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.' 'From Kirkus Reviews'
 ""Millennial murk that, under the title Chika Kakumei, was a 1985 best-seller in Japan. A former official at his homeland's redoubtable Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Sakaiya prophesies a brave new postindustrial world in which leisure time and wisdom abound but material as well as human resources are in short supply. In the Arcadian environment he envisions, the mass-produced manufactures that underpin modern consumer societies will yield to goods that somehow combine utility with the equivalent of intelligence and distinctively personal appeal. Unfortunately, the author is decidedly vague as to what constitutes a so-called knowledge-value product, making it almost impossible to gain more than an impression of what the near- and longer-term future might hold--if his predictions come true. Paradoxically, perhaps, Sakaiya's projections are based on notably specific conclusions drawn from selective surveys of Middle Eastern, Oriental, and Western civilizations. The author espouses cyclical theory to the extent that he dwells on instances from the past illustrating how conspicuous consumption gave way to thrift, and materialism to spiritual values. In like vein, Sakaiya makes a persuasive case for the proposition that art and fashion are harbingers of marketplace trends. Of particular interest to US readers who bear with the author's discontinuous critique is his conviction that America's open society is better equipped than that of conformist Japan to capitalize on New Age economics. Be that as it may, Sakaiya's musings are too mystical and mystifying to provide a decent return on any time invested trying to make sense of them. --""

John Stanton, who gave up his career as a star NFL running back to serve after 9/11, has been killed in Iraq. Suddenly Abby's kitchen is overflowing with casseroles brought by the army wives' club to which she has never really belonged. And her in-laws arrange a lavish funeral at Arlington National Cemetery in spite of Abby's misgivings. John had grown to hate the war even though he loved his country, and Abby can't reconcile the complex man she knew with the version being portrayed by self-serving politicians, military, and the media.""
 ""Shell-shocked, Abby strives to cope with her own heartache while comforting John's loved ones, including his mother Sharice, his staunchly anti-war sister Madison, and his bitter younger brother Noah. But amidst her loss is a growing conviction that the truth about John's death is far from over.""

 ""is a story of loyalty and betrayal, of a shattered family's journey toward healing, and of the courage it takes to confront the truth not just about our enemies, but about those we love best.""]","['From Publishers Weekly'
 ""Noonan's timely debut tells the Pat Tillmanesque tale of a football star turned soldier gunned down in Iraq by friendly fire. Abby, John Stanton's widowed wife, wants answers from the tight-lipped military who insist John was killed by an insurgent, and John's parents want him lauded in a hero's burial in Arlington cemetery. Meanwhile, the real killer, a psychopath in John's battalion, comes home and wants to take over John's once-charmed life. Written with great insight into military families and the constant struggle between supporting the troops but not the war, Noonan delivers a fast-paced, character-driven tale with a touch of mystery. Her only misstep is revealing the killer's identity too early—a forgivable sin in this otherwise respectable drama.""

 ""Arguably, this is the best of the Blackford Oakes series. Since we first met him at a callow 26, in Saving the Queen, Oakes has maturedhe's become more worn around the edges, less abrasive and, as a result, more likable. It is now 1963; Castro and Khrushchev are bickering. With the help of the CIA (Operation Mongoose), President Kennedy is involved in three separate plots to assassinate Castro. The first twopresenting Castro with a toxic wetsuit and supplying his mistress with poison pills (both were actually attempted)fail. The third, providing a disillusioned Castro protege with a rifle (also a real CIA plan) looks the most promising. Oakes is sent to Cuba to help coordinate the uprising that will inevitably follow. Suddenly the CIA discovers that Castro is about to launch a medium-range missile (left from the Cuban missile crisis) at Dallas, Tex., and the president. It's up to Oakes to prevent an escalation of the Cold War. Buckley has abandoned straightforward narration for a series of rapid-fire, cinematic scenes that are sometimes confusing as they jump from Washington, D.C., to Moscow to Havana. On the plus side, this high-flying thriller is grounded in reality, thanks to Dorothy McCartney, research editor of the National Review, whose help Buckley acknowledges.

Learning that the Soviets have secretly left behind a single missile after the U.S. challenge, Castro masterminds a scenario that will see Kennedy dead whether by bullet or ballistic missile. Vital to the story's plot are various documented attempts on Castro's life, one Oakes's assignment, and the love affair between Blacky and Sally Partridge.

Books,Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball,4.5,18,"['Jerrold Casway’s fascinating biography of legendary baseball player Ed Delahanty (1867–1903) offers a compelling examination of the first “King of Swatsville’s” life and career, including the enigma surrounding his tragic and untimely death. Through Delahanty’s story, Casway traces the evolving character of major league baseball and its effect on the lives and ambitions of its athletes.'
 'Delahanty’s career spanned the last decades of the nineteenth century during a time when the sons of post-famine Irish refugees dominated the sport and changed the playing style of America’s national pastime. In this “Emerald Age” of baseball, Irish-American players comprised 30–50 percent of all players, managers, and team captains. Baseball for Delahanty and other young Irishmen was a ticket out of poverty and into a life of fame and fortune. The allure and promise of celebrity and wealth, however, were disastrous for Delahanty. He found himself enmeshed in desperate contract dealings and a gambling addiction that drove him to alcohol abuse. The owner of the fourth highest lifetime batting average, Delahanty mysteriously disappeared and was found at the bottom of Niagara’s Horseshoe Falls.'
 'This rich biography, which relies on previously unavailable family papers and court transcripts, as well as the colorful sports reporting of the period, will appeal to anyone interested in baseball, sports, or Irish history.']","['Review'
 ""“Long before the Red Sox traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees, Ed Delahanty was the 'King of Swatsville.' A player for the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Senators who still holds the record for the fourth highest lifetime batting average, Delahanty “personified the flamboyant, exciting spectator-favorite, the Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger” writes Jerrold Casway in""
 'Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball'
 "". He was the “handsome masculine athlete who was expected to live as large as he played.” And he did: Gambling his way into a drinking problem, he turned up dead at the bottom of Niagara's Horseshoe Falls.” ―""
 'The Washington Post'
 '""Jerrold Casway. . . has written a book that takes the romantic sheen off nineteenth-century baseball. The focus of his study is the Hall of Fame outfielder and first baseman Edward Delahanty, one of the most feared batsmen of his time. More substantively, Casway places Delahanty at the fore of the ethnic and labor strife that marked early professional baseball. Poor Ed Delahanty ended up at the bottom of Niagara Falls. Whether he jumped, was pushed, or dumped remains a mystery, although each scenario was plausible given professional baseball\'s penchant for treating its ethnic workforce as interchangeable parts in its myth-making machine."" ―'
 'Journal of American Culture'
 '"". . . Casway provides valuable insight into baseball\'s past, paying tribute to an athlete, who, as fellow Irishman John McGraw noted, was unquestionably'
 'the Babe Ruth of his day.' '"" ―' 'North Dakota Quarterly'
 '“. . . Casway. . . provides a colorful study of the life and times of one of baseball’s earliest sluggers at a time when the game was the unchallenged national pastime. Casway has written a fascinating, carefully researched biography of a long-neglected baseball hero that will appeal to scholars as well as general readers.'
 'Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball'
 'is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the culture and evolution of the national pastime at the turn of the century.” ―'
 'History: Reviews of New Books'
 '“Baseball enthusiasts will find this book one of the most satisfying biographies of recent years. . . Readers who approach this volume from the perspective of Irish Studies will find something even more rewarding in the larger story that underpins Casway’s book. ―'
 'Irish Literary Supplement'
 '“. . . impressive and persuasive. . . Casway. . . shows us how baseball when it was evolving. . . can help us better appreciate the joys and miseries of baseball today.” ―'
 'The Virginia Quarterly Review'
 '“. . . this book presents an interesting picture of the early days of baseball. One hundred years hasn’t really changed the sport. Many young men still come into fame and fortune before they are mature enough to handle it. Delahanty’s demise stands as an eerie precursor to those athletes of the modern era whose careers were cut short by drug use.” ―'
 'The Tampa Tribune'
 '""I recommend Jerrold Casway’s new book. . . . Through Delahanty’s career, Mr. Casway ably tells the story of the wars between the National League and the upstart American League that culminated in the National Agreement and ended in the comparably settled Deadball Era."" ―'
 'New York Sun'
 '“Sad and compelling . . . this is a lucid examination of the ‘behind the scenes’ complexities of the national pasttime. . . . This is not an uplifting story, but it is essential for understanding how difficulties in a fledgling sport led to the unfortunate downfall of a great athlete.” ―'

 '"". . . this is an estimable biography. If Ed Delahanty has been a neglected figure in baseball history, now, thanks to Jerrold Casway\'s dedication and perseverance, he has finally received the kind of thorough treatment he has long deserved."" ―'

Books,"Modern Fishing Lure Collectibles, Vol. 3: Identification & Value Guide",4.3,10,"[""Like Volumes 1 and 2, Modern Fishing Lure Collectibles, Volume 3, deals primarily with items made since 1940 in the United States. Volume 3 continues author Russell Lewis's tradition of providing large, crisp photos, realized prices for items, and histories to go along with both well-known and often forgotten fishing lure companies. Expanded information on companies that could not be fully covered in Volumes 1 and 2 is included, as well as new companies: Horrocks-Ibbotson Company, Wood's Lures, L & S Minnows, and Cicso Kid Lures, to name just a few. The book gives the reader a true image of a particular year in fishing tackle history through advertisements from the time period, detailed facts, and representative photographs. While Volume 2 gave the complete history for nearly 50 years by examining vintage catalogs, this volume shows many of the actual rods and reels in photographs with approximate values when known for items from 1937 through 1952. Lewis gives a complete history of all rods, reels, and lures available for sale in the United States for 1952. This volume contains no repeats from Lewis's other books and identifies previously unknown items. It is a perfect companion to author Lewis's other volumes. 2005 values.""]","['Review'
 'The great variety of fishing lures with the differences in their bright markings and sizes can be disarming to even experienced collectors. With his 20 years experience as a collector, Lewis makes sense of this area of collecting by classifying the lures by their makers, and with introductory essays on ""Dating Techniques"" and the ""Modern Era."" The chapters with the classifications are more than simple listings of numerous lures....-Henry Berry'
